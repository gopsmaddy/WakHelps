How to find the version a Java class was compiled with?

I wanted to lookup the Java version a class was compiled with. I was getting an error:
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: (MyClass) bad major version at offset=6


javap -verbose MyClass | grep major

The major version tells the Java version used. Here are some example values:

* Java 1.2 uses major version 46
* Java 1.3 uses major version 47
* Java 1.4 uses major version 48
* Java 5   uses major version 49
* Java 6   uses major version 50
* Java 7   uses major version 51
