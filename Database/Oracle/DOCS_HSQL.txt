hi
[10:17:53] Robiul Hussain: hello
[10:18:19] WMuzammil: select a,b,c from mytable where id ????
[10:18:30] WMuzammil: if Id has more than one values
[10:18:44] WMuzammil: how did you get it from hibernation?
[10:19:01] Robiul Hussain: hmm
[10:19:16] WMuzammil: this is in ManageToken with mutliple selections..
[10:19:22] Robiul Hussain: yep
[10:19:24] Robiul Hussain: let me check
[10:19:27] WMuzammil: you did something..
[10:19:33] Robiul Hussain: yeah i did
[10:19:38] Robiul Hussain: but forgotten let me check
[10:19:44] WMuzammil: ok..thank
[10:20:40] Robiul Hussain:  query.setParameterList("tokenProductId", filter.getTokenProductIds());
[10:21:04] WMuzammil: what is come in filter.getTokenProductIds() ?
[10:21:30] WMuzammil: is that string or list?
[10:21:41] Robiul Hussain: list
[10:21:48] Robiul Hussain: of long in this case
[10:21:52] WMuzammil: java.util.list?
[10:21:58] Robiul Hussain: yeah
[10:22:10] Robiul Hussain: i think hibernate handles the conversion within the sql
[10:22:39] WMuzammil: can you see in log the HSQL for this scenario?
[10:22:50] Robiul Hussain: i have seen
[10:22:53] Robiul Hussain: let me check
[10:23:03] WMuzammil: how does it look like?
[10:23:09] Robiul Hussain: just going to send it to uyou
[10:23:16] WMuzammil: thanks

[10:25:31] WMuzammil: ?
[10:25:42] Robiul Hussain: aaah
[10:25:50] Robiul Hussain: that was the magic you did
[10:25:57] Robiul Hussain: if it isnt passed through
[10:26:02] Robiul Hussain: we say 1=1
[10:26:04] Robiul Hussain: os 0=1
[10:26:26] Robiul Hussain: as non mandatory fields
[10:26:45] WMuzammil: [10:21] WMuzammil: 

<<< filter.getTokenProductIds() is represent as TA.token_product_id in (?, ?, ?, ?)
[10:27:07] Robiul Hussain: yes, if we say query.setParameterlist
[10:27:15] WMuzammil: Ok...thanks
[10:27:38] Robiul Hussain: well the query was written beforehande
[10:27:41] WMuzammil: im trying to do samething with eclipselink ORM
[10:27:42] Robiul Hussain: we just pass in parameters
[10:27:51] Robiul Hussain: ok
[10:28:02] WMuzammil: i will it has same features
[10:28:07] Robiul Hussain: ok
[10:28:29] WMuzammil: sorry i will see is there any similarities in eclipselink oRM
